  <ul>
    <li>Added changelog page</li>
    <li>Fixed overfitting consonant mutations in verb pairs</li>
    <li>Fixed prefix analysis in verb tree</li>
    <li>Gave a few specific words overrides</li>
    <li>Added -нуть verbs to the full verb lists</li>
    <li>
      Removed unnecessary flag buttons from verb list outputs (pairs and trees),
      as these are generated wholesale and cannot be updated individually
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed some consonant cluster misformations, and arranged for
      multiplicative correction going forward
    </li>
    <li>
      Made verb lists generate from the product of the dictionary key, meaning
      that database growth is slightly more effective at improving verb lists
    </li>
  </ul>
