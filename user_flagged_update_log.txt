
When a user manually labels a word as in need of update, special attention is given to the entry,
by logging the original here, along with the updated form given by pinging the Russian dictioanary website 
(which *may* still give the wrong answer, or more likely, ping a non-existent page, leaving the word updated to 
the autochthonic form + '**', e.g.  Хэндерсон**)
