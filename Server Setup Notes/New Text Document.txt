"""Do not downgrade the system version: it's likely that some parts of the system would stop working. Never change /usr/bin/python3, and avoid putting an older version of python3 before it in the $PATH.

The deadsnakes archive provides packages of most supported Python versions for currently supported Ubuntu LTS versions. To make these packages available, follow the usual instructions to enable a PPA. Then install the package(s) you want.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
You can then create a virtual environment for your chosen Python version and with a chosen set of packages.

python3.6 -m venv ~/python/foo-3.6
sh -c '.export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1;  ~/python/foo-3.6/bin/activate; pip install â€¦'
To run a program in this environment, source the bin/activate script in a shell.

$ bash
$ export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
$ . ~/python/foo-3.6/bin/activate
$ ./my_python_program"""
