 <h1>Russian Vocabulary List Maker</h1>
 <img src="/Underline-Stroke.png">
 <p> Explanation Text </p><!--The most important thing for language learning is not so much to use the most effective techniques for learning,
     but rather to use techniques which can be sustained for the longest period of time. Among this is the act of varying 
     which techniques are used to study a language, and what types of language input are used. At beginner to intermediate 
     stages, one of the available tools is material that comes with a corresponding vocabulary list. While vocabulary lists 
     are not an impressively effective way of learning, it is possible for them to make otherwise quite inaccessible texts 
     perfectly comprehensible, and a much better form of input. Advanced learners basically lose access to materials with 
     vocabulary lists. So, although a vocabulary list in essence isn't the best way to learn almost anything, 
     mostly-comprehensible, native language-input most certainly is, and being able to create a vocabulary list easily can 
     radically increase material of this kind.</p>
 <p>Advanced learners benefit most from engaging with native language material: speeches, podcasts, movies, internet videos, 
    and, most of all, books, made by Russians for Russian speakers. This application can offer more advanced learners of 
    Russian the ability to create an organized, efficient vocabulary list for large amounts of native material. By putting 
    in a whole YouTube transcript, and studying the most frequently used, novel vocabulary beforehand, the student has greatly 
    increased access to increasingly high level mostly-comprehensible language input.</p>
